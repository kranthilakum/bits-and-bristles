A few years ago, I splurged on a portable Bluetooth speaker. It was a bit pricey, but I had this undeniable desire to own it. So, I opted for the EMI option, committing to paying it off over a whole year. To add a twist, I had to use my wife's phone to connect to it because my own phone had a somewhat outdated Bluetooth technology. Back then, I thought Bluetooth was universal and nothing groundbreaking would come to it. I cherished the speaker, yet, oddly enough, it ended up mostly sitting on the shelf, occasionally making an appearance.

Then, COVID-19 hit, and I found myself stuck far away from home for over a year. Upon returning home, I was eager to bring back the joy of music into my life, only to find that my beloved speaker refused to charge or respond in any way. It was a disappointing moment, and I couldn't help but blame myself for neglecting its charging needs.

Turning to the internet for answers, I visited the official website, half-expecting my once-beloved speaker to be discontinued. To my relief, it was still on sale after all these years. Intrigued, I navigated to the product support page and discovered something unexpected - this speaker had software inside, and an upgrade was available. Skeptical but hopeful, I downloaded the upgrade software, installed it on my MacBook, and connected the seemingly lifeless speaker.

As the upgrade commenced, I couldn't shake my suspicion, as the speaker showed no signs of life during the installation process. However, after the upgrade was completed, the speaker's LED started to blink, and lo and behold, my once-dead speaker was back among the living. The joy that surged through me was immeasurable.

Eager to test its revived capabilities, I connected the speaker to my phone and played "Dancing in the Dark" by Bruce Springsteenâ€”somehow fitting for my situation. Not only was I ecstatic, but even my children were thrilled with the quality sound emanating from this small, portable device.

When I shared this entire saga with my wife, she wisely suggested that I should use it regularly rather than relegating it to the closet.

**Lessons to Learn:**
1. **Stay Updated:** Technological advancements can surprise us. Always check for updates and upgrades to make the most of your devices.
2. **Regular Use:** Don't shy away from using your belongings regularly. They are meant to be enjoyed and can often benefit from regular activity.
3. **Persistence Pays Off:** Instead of giving up on a seemingly malfunctioning device, explore all available options. Persistence can lead to unexpected solutions.

**Moral of the Story:**
Desire and neglect can be a deadly combination. Desire leads us to acquire things, but neglect can cause us to lose them.

Desire lead to pain, but persistence lead to gain.

Regular care and attention, coupled with a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances, can bring life back to even the most seemingly obsolete or neglected aspects of our lives.
