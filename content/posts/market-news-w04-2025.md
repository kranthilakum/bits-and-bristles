The Indian stock market has seen some intense volatility recently, as major players in the market witnessed substantial declines. Last week, the combined market capitalization of four of the top 10 most valued companies in India shrank by a staggering ₹1,25,397.45 crore. Among these heavyweights, Reliance Industries took the biggest hit, a reflection of the current weak investor sentiment plaguing Dalal Street. Other stocks experiencing similar pressure included the likes of SBI, HDFC, LIC, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, TCS, HUL, ITC, and Infosys. This trend of selling and cautious sentiment continues as investors grapple with macroeconomic challenges.

### FPI Exodus: A Concerning Trend

The exodus of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) from Indian equities is now in full swing. This month, FPIs have withdrawn ₹66,602 crore from Indian markets so far, a worrying trend exacerbated by the depreciation of the Indian rupee, rising US bond yields, and expectations of a lackluster earnings season. After a decent inflow of ₹15,446 crore in December 2024, FPIs have been sellers on almost every day this January, except for January 2nd. The financial sector, a major part of their portfolio, has borne the brunt of this selling, while the IT sector has managed to show signs of resilience.

### Macro Pressure: The Continued Depreciation of the Rupee

The relentless depreciation of the Indian rupee is also having a far-reaching impact on investor confidence. The dollar index remains firmly above 108, and the 10-year US bond yield is holding steady above 4.5%. These factors continue to pressure foreign investors and are expected to keep the selling momentum alive in the near future. With high valuations in Indian equities, a potential slowdown in corporate earnings, and global macroeconomic headwinds, caution remains the name of the game.

Additionally, the unpredictable nature of Donald Trump’s policies is also keeping investors on edge, prompting them to avoid riskier investment opportunities.
