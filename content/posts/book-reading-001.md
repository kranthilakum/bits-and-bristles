## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson

Your success is determined by your answer to the question: "_What pain can you sustain?_" A person who enjoys the struggles of a gym will get in better shape than someone who hates it. A person who values the struggles of studying will get a better education than someone who doesn't. A person who enjoys long work weeks will outperform someone who sees it as a burden.

> “Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.”

> “Life is essentially an endless series of problems. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of another.”

Stop looking for someone to blame and take full responsibility for your problems, you will feel empowered to do something about them. When you take responsibility for a problem, you take responsibility for how that problem makes you feel. If you have a problem, you decide how you want to respond to the situation. You are responsible for your own happiness.

Be aware of any outdated or superficial values you are needlessly suffering to uphold, and replace them with more meaningful values, values you are willing to suffer for. Life is full of suffering, but your suffering will feel meaningful if you choose values that are worth suffering for.

> “To be happy we need something to solve. Happiness is therefore a form of action;”

> “This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes.”

> “Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.”

> “The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.”

> “Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy.”

> “Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual. We have so much fucking stuff and so many opportunities that we don’t even know what to give a fuck about anymore.”

> “If you want to change how you see your problems, you have to change what you value and/or how you measure failure/success.”
