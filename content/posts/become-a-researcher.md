A researcher is a person who is engaged in the systematic investigation of a subject in order to discover new knowledge or to establish new facts. Researchers use various methods to gather and analyze data, including experimentation, observation, survey research, and secondary data analysis. They may work in academia, industry, government, or other organizations, and may specialize in fields such as science, medicine, social sciences, humanities, or engineering. Researchers are often motivated by a desire to advance knowledge in their field, to solve practical problems, or to contribute to the development of new technologies or policies.

#### Becoming a researcher involves several steps:

__Education__: Most researchers have a minimum of a Master's degree in a relevant field such as psychology, sociology, statistics, biology, or political science. A PhD is often preferred for academic research positions.

__Skill Development__: Researchers should be proficient in statistical methods, research design, and data analysis. This can be accomplished through coursework, self-study, or practical experience.

__Gaining Experience__: Researchers often start by working as research assistants, data analysts, or surveyors. They can then move on to more senior roles such as project managers or principal investigators.

__Networking__: Researchers should attend conferences, join professional organizations, and collaborate with other researchers to build a network of contacts and learn about new research opportunities.

__Conducting Research__: Researchers must have a deep understanding of their field and be able to design, execute, and publish their own research studies.

A researcher should have a good understanding of the following statistical methods:

- Descriptive statistics
- Inferential statistics
- Hypothesis testing
- Regression analysis
- Multivariate analysis
- Bayesian analysis
- Non-parametric methods

In terms of research methods, a researcher should be familiar with:

- Quantitative research methods
- Qualitative research methods
- Experimental research design
- Quasi-experimental research design
- Survey research
- Case study research
- Grounded theory research.

It's important for researchers to stay up-to-date with new methods and techniques in their field, as well as to have strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Ultimately, becoming a successful researcher requires a combination of education, skill development, experience, and a strong passion for the field.
