**Research question**: What experiences may directly or indirectly affect the willingness of Indian women to apply for Software Engineering (SE) roles?

### Research design

To design a research study to answer the above research question, you could use a **mixed methods approach** that combines both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Here is one possible design for this study:

**Literature review**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature to gain an understanding of the factors that influence women's career choices, including barriers to entry into the software engineering field.

**Qualitative phase**: Conduct semi-structured interviews with Indian women who work in software engineering or are interested in pursuing a career in this field. The goal of these interviews is to gather information about their experiences and perspectives on the factors that influence their willingness to apply for SE roles.

**Quantitative phase**: Develop a survey to collect data from a larger sample of Indian women who are interested in or working in software engineering. The survey should include questions about their experiences and perceptions of the field, as well as demographic information.

**Data analysis**: Analyze the qualitative data using thematic analysis to identify common themes and patterns in the participants' experiences. Analyze the quantitative data using descriptive and inferential statistics to test hypotheses and identify relationships between different variables.

**Results and discussion**: Present the results of the study in a comprehensive manner, highlighting the key findings and their implications for both academia and industry. Discuss limitations and implications for future research.

**Conclusion**: Summarize the main findings and conclusions of the study, and provide recommendations for promoting the participation of Indian women in software engineering.
