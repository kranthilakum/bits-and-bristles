Climate change can shift the range of species, bringing them into closer contact with new populations. When temperatures rise or fall, when the rains are heavier or a drought lasts longer, then the conditions for life change. Insects, bats or ticks that often carry the pathogens of diseases like malaria, Rift Valley fever, cholera and dengue are likely to move geographically. Climate and land use changes over the coming decades will together produce many new opportunities for viruses to jump between species and cross to humans.

Climate change can lead to shifts in the distribution of species, causing them to come into contact with new populations. This happens because when the climate is unstable, environments change rapidly and provide opportunities for new species to colonize and evolve. As temperatures rise, weather patterns such as rainfall, humidity, winds, and sunlight intensity also change, leading to increased frequency and severity of natural disasters like cyclones, floods, droughts, and heatwaves. These events impact the survival, spread, and reproduction of pathogens related to various diseases like cholera, typhoid, filariasis, leptospirosis, malaria, yellow fever, and others. 

While climate change doesn't directly cause diseases, it acts as a multiplier, increasing and accelerating the risk of infectious diseases emerging. Warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns drive the movements of vectors like mosquitoes, ticks, and bats carrying these pathogens, potentially allowing them to jump between different animal hosts and infect humans. 

The combination of climatic and land use changes expected in the future will create numerous chances for viruses to transmit between species and infect human populations. For instance, a heatwave in Siberia thawed permafrost and revealed a decomposing carcass from several years ago, infected with anthrax. Approximately ninety individuals required hospitalization due to exposure to the pathogen. 

Previously frozen viruses and bacteria can remain alive for thousands of years, and scientists suspect that there could be significant amounts stored beneath melting glaciers and soils worldwide. Consequently, we should anticipate additional revelations about dormant yet viable pathogens. Over the previous half-decade, the European Space Agency identified multiple antimicrobial-resistant microbes in the Alaskan permafrost, while Chinese researchers discovered thirty-three undetectable viruses in ice cores stretching back around eleven thousand years. As global warming proceeds, further findings are likely to emerge.
