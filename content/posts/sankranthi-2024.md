### Rediscovering Roots, Navigating Detours, and Unearthing History

Embark on a family road trip from Hyderabad to Ongole during the festive season of Sankranti. Our family journeyed from the bustling city of Hyderabad to the town of Ongole. Navigating through less-trodden roads, unexpected detours, the journey unveils historic landmarks and cultural anecdotes, offering a blend of nostalgia and new discoveries. Here is my experience of the road trip and the scenic beauty blending tradition with the joy of exploration that added a unique charm to the journey.

### A Long-Awaited Escape

Several months had passed since our last visit to Ongole. Amid the hustle of daily life - blame it on the demanding job or the bustling schedule of my children's school, the opportunity to travel finally presented itself on the eve of Sankranti. My wife, drawn to the tranquility and cultural essence of the quaint house in Ongole, persistently persuaded her father to make the journey. She envisioned our children relishing the festival culture just as she had during her childhood.  Little did we know that this Sankranti expedition would turn into a memorable adventure, taking us through unexpected routes and historical landscapes.

The air quality, the cultural vibrancy of Ongole is far better than Hyderabad, and its proximity to her native place, merely a hundred kilometers away, made it an ideal retreat. The expansive space allowed our children to frolic freely, offering a welcome change for mental reprieve. Personally, I found solace in the variety of house plants and the open spaces, making it a preferred spot for remote work.

On 13th January 2024, around 8 am, we set out in our humble Kia Seltos from Hyderabad. Our first pitstop was Pargi, a quaint village where we picked up my sister-in-law and her two-year-old child, where they had recently moved. The roads were surprisingly clear, as most people were traveling to their hometowns for the festivities.

### Navigating Detours

During festive times, the journey home is often fraught with traffic, and this Sankranti was no exception. Originally planning to take our usual route via Ramoji City to Choutuppal, Narketpalli, Nalgonda, Miryalaguda, Pidugurallu, Addanki, and finally reaching Ongole. However, a last-minute change in plans occurred when we received intel from my wife's friend about a massive traffic jam at the city exit, turning a one-hour stretch into a daunting four-hour crawl. A quick decision was made, diverting us towards the less-traveled path through Nagarjuna Sagar.

This detour led us to choose the less-traveled path through Nagarjuna Sagar. The roads were narrow and lacked dividers, increasing the risk of head-on collisions with oncoming vehicles. My uncle expertly steered through most of the journey. For the most part, my uncle took the wheel, ensuring our safety through the journey. It wasn't until the stretch between Mall and Peddavoora that I took over, only to inadvertently head towards Miryalaguda due to a sudden route change by Google Maps. Uncle, ever watchful, noticed the deviation and swiftly corrected our course back towards Macharla, the intended route. The Google Maps algorithm, in its attempt to optimize our journey, had momentarily led us astray.

### The Uncharted Route

The journey through Macharla, a route through dense forests and Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir, took us on a scenic route. The roads were narrow, and the traffic was sparse, but the journey was not without its challenges. The roads were in poor condition. Yet, the journey had its silver lining. We encountered historic places, passed through dense forests, witnessed the grandeur of Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, and revisited memories from my childhood. Although my children were more engrossed in mindless YouTube shorts than the historical significance, the peaceful ambiance remained unchanged, echoing the reasons why Buddhists chose this region for meditation. A humorous moment unfolded at a police checkpoint when an officer jokingly remarked on my daughter's YouTube indulgence, suggesting detention, much to our collective amusement.

### Echoes of History

Continuing our route, we reached Karampudi, a small village resonating with an impactful story from the 11th centuryâ€”the Battle of Palnadu. My uncle reminded us of the Battle of Palnadu, fought between nobles, left an indelible mark on this place. Intrigued, I delved into the historical accounts, exploring the clash between Veera Vaishnavism and Veera Saivism, led by Brahmanaidu and role of the Velama community in the battle. The battle was a turning point in the history of the region, leading to the decline of the Velama community (Padmanayakas) and the rise of the Reddy community.

The old tamarind trees lining both sides of the road stood as silent witnesses to the passage of time. The old villages, dilapidated yet resilient, stood as testaments to the enduring spirit of the past. Ancient tamarind trees lined both sides of the road, their dense canopies casting soothing shadows against the sun, provided a cool respite.

We finally arrived in Ongole, exhausted and feeling the weight of the day. Despite the fatigue, the journey was fulfilling, offering scenic wonders and glimpses of a bygone era and enriching our understanding of the region's history.

### Tradition Meets Modernity

As I retired to bed, the exhaustion of the journey gave way to a sense of accomplishment. Our journey had not only reunited us with our roots but had also woven a tapestry of history, culture, and family bonds. The detours, though unexpected, added a layer of adventure, making the journey more than just a physical passage.

In the end, it was not just a road trip; it was a voyage through time, reconnecting with traditions, unearthing history, and creating lasting memories. The charm of our peaceful abode and cultural richness, had once again left an indelible mark on our hearts.
