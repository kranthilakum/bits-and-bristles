Infertility is one of the biggest problems facing today's Indian society. Fertility has fallen to an all-time low of 1.6 in cities and 2.1 in villages. Urura Fertility Centers are now springing up. In 2012 alone, over a thousand children were born through surrogacy. Half of them are children of foreign parents. The infertility diagnosis and treatment market in the country is growing at an annual rate of twelve and a half percent from 2022 to 2028. No other specialty is growing so fast in the field of medicine and health.

India currently holds the top spot in terms of population, yet the abundance of fertility clinics offering procedures like IVF and surrogacy suggests otherwise. Such facilities outnumber traditional healthcare centers, highlighting the paradoxical nature of modern lifestyles. With approximately 3 crore individuals afflicted by infertility in India, according to estimates from the Indian Society of Assisted Reproduction, this issue represents a major challenge for contemporary society. While a fertility rate of 2.2 is considered a stabilizing factor known as the "replacement rate," India's fertility rate has dropped significantly below this threshold, reaching an alarmingly low level of 2.0 overall, 1.6 in urban areas, and 2.1 in rural regions. As a nation comprising a significant portion of youthful inhabitants during their reproductive stages, the severity of this dilemma demands immediate attention.

The falling fertility rates across various regions raise crucial concerns about societal norms and values. A study conducted by Orion Market Research predicts that the infertility diagnostics and treatments industry in India will expand by 12.5% annually between 2022 and 2028. Another analysis by a consultant agency forecasts a tripling of the fertility market by 2026, signifying substantial growth in the medical sector pertaining to reproduction. In contrast, no other specialized area of healthcare is experiencing a comparable pace of expansion.

Past analyses indicated that around one-quarter of couples could anticipate conceiving within a month following their wedding ceremony, provided they did not utilize birth control techniques. Around sixty percent of these couples would conceive within a year, while seventy-five percent would do so inside nine months, and ninety percent would achieve pregnancy within eighteen months of wedlock. Nonetheless, infertility issues exist despite the absence of apparent obstacles; however, such instances remain uncommon. Thus, when couples fail to conceive even after two years, anxiety sets in. Nevertheless, societal priorities and lifestyles have altered considerably since earlier times.

Previously, societies tended to blame women primarily for infertility difficulties. Nowadays, it is more commonly recognized as a medical concern affecting both men and women equally. The World Health Organization advocates treating infertility as a public health issue and encourages policymakers to adopt corresponding measures. While physiological factors contribute substantially to infertility, lifestyle choices play a considerable role in exacerbating the predicament. Stress levels, dietary habits, and familial and social surroundings aggravate infertility problems for both sexes. Approximately forty percent of cases stemming from female causes, forty percent emanating from male causes, and the remaining proportion arises from joint or indeterminate sources.

Here's a summary of the factors contributing to declining fertility rates mentioned in the text:

For men:
1. Reduced sperm count - linked to environmental pollution, smoking, drinking, mobile phone usage, obesity, lack of sleep, and prolonged exposure to heat.
2. Decrease in sperm quality - observed since 1979 due to addictions such as alcohol and drugs.
3. Increase in scrotal temperature - caused by wearing tight clothes, working in hot climates, using gadgets excessively, and placing phones too close to test tubes containing sperm cells.
4. Varicocele - an issue where blood vessels around the testicles thicken, causing increased temperatures and reduced sperm production.
5. Retrograde ejaculation - a condition where semen enters the bladder instead of being expelled during ejaculation.
6. Hormonal problems leading to symptoms such as hair loss, enlargement of breasts, low sperm counts, and testicular cancer.

For women:
1. Decline in egg numbers - starting earlier than before, possibly due to malnutrition.
2. Postponement of childbirth - making conception more challenging beyond the age of 35.
3. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) - characterized by irregular menstrual cycles resulting from hormonal imbalances.
4. Fallopian tube obstruction, uterine problems such as cysts and endometriosis, hormonal imbalances, frequent vaginal infections, and sexually transmitted diseases hindering conception.
5. Earlier menopause in India compared to Western countries, reducing the reproductive period.
6. Common issues affecting both men and women include obesity, diet, and poor sleeping habits negatively impacting fertility levels.

Overall, lifestyle choices such as smoking, drinking, and using electronic devices extensively contribute to declining fertility rates in both men and women. Additionally, environmental pollutants, malnutrition, and hormonal imbalances play significant roles in reducing fertility levels. Lastly, postponing childbirth beyond certain ages can make conceiving harder.

### Pollution is also a cause!

A recent publication titled "Countdown" highlights the negative impacts of endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs), found in products like plastics, shampoo, and chemical disinfectants, on fertility in both men and women. According to a study conducted by a team headed by Shana H. Swan, the sperm count of men in western nations has declined by 59% since 1973 up till 2011. These chemicals disturb the functioning of hormones produced by the body's glands, resulting in numerous alterations in bodily functions. There are different categories of EDCs, including bisphenols, folates, and the DDT group, commonly found in cosmetic products, plastic goods, and chemical cleaners. Research on these substances is currently ongoing on a broad scale in North America and Europe. Experts advise people to increase their awareness regarding this issue because even though various assisted reproduction techniques are accessible, it is still necessary to comprehend the extent of the problem.

### Awareness is important

One patient visited her gynecologist after failing at IUI (Intra Uterine Insemination) 21 times in 10 years. Upon examination, it was discovered that her fallopian tubes were fully obstructed, which prevented natural conception. Once the blockage was resolved, she became pregnant spontaneously. This woman faced emotional stress, travel costs, and medical fees amounting to hundreds of thousands of rupees due to multiple visits to hospitals under false pretenses. Similar stories emerge when discussing infertility issues. Women may require numerous cycles of ovulation stimulation, typically limited to no more than six sessions. However, some individuals persistently seek additional examinations and medications despite professional guidance, worsening their condition further. 

It is crucial to recognize that both males and females dealing with infertility must educate themselves thoroughly before pursuing any remedy. Frequent consultations with physicians result in repeated testing and drug administration exacerbating problems rather than solving them. Various factors lead to infertility, and determining the root cause requires consultation with seasoned healthcare professionals following appropriate investigative procedures. The reasons will be clear if the couple undergo necessary tests after consulting an experienced doctor, affiliated to an ICMR accredited clinic. 

Remember, every person's body is unique. So keep in mind that treatments are also individual. Also, do not expect any treatment to be 100% effective. If we understand the warning of the researchers and make changes to our lifestyle accordingly... we can become mothers and fathers without the need for IVF!

### For whom... what kind of treatment..?

To summarize, there are various options available under assisted reproductive technology beyond just test tube babies or surrogacy. The choice of treatment depends on the specific problem facing the couple. Some common procedures include laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, varicocelectomy, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro fertilization (IVF), ICSI, egg and sperm freezing, and preserving embryos post-fertilization through IVF. Doctors will recommend the most suitable course of action based on thorough testing and evaluation. Couples should follow these recommendations carefully to avoid unnecessary interventions and expenses. Additionally, it's essential to note that none of these methods guarantee complete success, but adherence to specialist advice combined with lifestyle modifications could significantly improve chances of conceiving naturally. Ultimately, seeking expert counsel and diligent self-education about infertility issues is critical to choosing the best approach for one's unique situation.

#### Procedures illustrated

__Laparoscopy, Hysteroscopy__: Problems like endometriosis, ovarian cysts, obstructions in the fallopian tubes can all be treated with minor laparoscopic surgery. Hysteroscopy is done for problems like fibroids and polyps in the uterus. This is also a mild treatment.

__Varicocelectomy__: After analysis of sperm cells in men, it is enough to use drugs to increase the number quality and reduce infections if there are any. Medicines are also enough for hormone problems. Varicocele, a thickening of the blood vessels near the testicles, may require surgery. If there are no such problems and no children are born then...

__IUI__: Intrauterine insemination is a procedure in which the sperm cells are not able to reach the egg - directly into the uterus at the right time for the egg to be released.

__IVF__: All the eggs and sperm are fertilized in the laboratory and after the embryo is formed, it is inserted into the mother's womb. After that, the whole procedure is like a normal pregnancy. Before being implanted in the womb, the fetus is genetically tested to ensure that there are no defects.

__ICSI__: In this procedure, the sperm is injected directly into the egg. It is used when the sperm count is low and of poor quality.

__Egg and Sperm Freezing__: This is the method that is being chosen by those who want to wait for a while for a child. Eggs and sperm can be retrieved and stored at the age of high fertility, and children can be conceived whenever desired.

It is also possible to preserve the embryo after fertilization in the IVF system. It has become a boon especially for those undergoing treatment for various types of cancer. This procedure is chosen as per the doctor's instructions before the start of chemotherapy. The embryo is preserved in a frozen state until the cancer treatment is completed. After that, the embryo is implanted in the womb and the pregnancy is carried out.
