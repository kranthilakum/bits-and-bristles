Metaprogramming is a programming technique that involves manipulating and interacting with other programs as data. This allows a program to read, generate, analyze, transform, and even modify itself while it is running. This approach can help reduce the amount of code required to solve a problem, leading to shorter development time.

Metaprogramming can be used to shift computations from runtime to compile time, generate code using compile time computations, and enable self-modifying code. The ability of a programming language to serve as its own metalanguage enables reflective programming, which is known as _reflection_. Reflection is a valuable language feature that facilitates metaprogramming.

> A quine or self-copy/replicat-ing program is a computer program that takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
